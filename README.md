## Overview
“Run Run little monkey” is a simple trap-based maze game where the player has to help a little monkey to find the right exiting tile in the shortest time possible. You can create any level that you would want by placing different tiles on the screen. There are road tiles where the monkey is allowed to walk, grass and decoration tiles where is not allowed to, and finally, tiles that have special effects when the player steps on them, these are called trap tiles. In the main game, the only visible tile will be the one where the player is standing, the rest will be hidden so the player will have to choose the direction he wants to go into by memorizing the places he has already gone to. This game was made fully using the java language. <br /> <br />
This game is not like the other games where the player that hosts the game will be the one playing, it is more about creating different levels and letting your friend try and see how fast they can finish your maze. It’s fun and easy to play and even to edit a level, while the one creating the level can be very tricky and play around with the different special tiles. At the end, when the player that is trying to solve the maze finally succeeds he will see the full level as well.
